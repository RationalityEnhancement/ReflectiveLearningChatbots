# Defining Your Experiment 

_(up to date for first prototype)_

An experiment is completely defined by a JSON file. This will have to be named "_config.json_" without quotes. The remainder of this description will show you the mandatory and optional features an experiment requires to run.

Follow this documentation along with an [example experiment configuration](./exampleConfig.json) to see how the following example would translate into an actual document. 

```
experimentName : "ExampleExperiment"                    // Mandatory: name of your experiment 
                                                        //    - can be any string of characters
experimentId : "experiment123"                          // Mandatory: unique identifier for your experiment
                                                        //    - can be any string of characters

This experiment config file will result in a chatbot that has the following functionality:

* When user sends `/start`, begin by asking the setup questions:
  * First ask to choose one language which user prefers (`setupQuestions.lang`)
    * This will be stored to the `language` variable of participant parameters
  * Then ask immediately after to type in PID (`setupQuestions.pid`)
    * This will be stored to the `pid` variable of participant parameters
* After setup questions are complete, questions specified in `scheduledQuestions` are scheduled for the given times.
  * On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday at 09:00, the chatbot will ask the user to select multiple emotions they are feeling.

Relevant data that is saved in the database:
* All custom participant parameters and values
* List of answer received with the following information:
  * ID of question asked
  * Text of question asked
  * Timestamp of answer
  * Content(s) of answer
