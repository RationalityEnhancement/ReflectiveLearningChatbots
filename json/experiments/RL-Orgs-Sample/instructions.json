    "Typically, you talk to me only when I ask you a question. However, you may also sometimes initiate a conversation with me on your own (see the special commands below). The answers I request from you will include typing out messages, inputting numbers, and selecting from given choices, among others. To help you understand how to answer, <b>I will send you a message after each question. These will tell you how to respond - so look out for them!</b> :eyes:\n\nI will ask you questions either at different points during the day, or right after you have answered a question. So, please bear with me and answer all my questions until I tell you we are finished!\n\nIf you don't answer certain questions, I will send you periodic reminders for you to answer them, so that we can move on to the next steps.",
    "<b>Special Commands:</b>\n\n* /help - If you need to be reminded of these instructions at any time, just send this command! \n\n* /repeat - If you need me to repeat a question before you have had the chance to submit a complete answer, send this command, and I will ask the question again! Keep in mind that <b>you will have to enter your full answer from the beginning after I repeat the question.</b> If there are no outstanding questions, you will just have to wait for the next time I ask one!\n\n* /talk - If you want to initiate a conversation with me about a particular topic, you can send this command. However, you can do this only to update your goals, after setting your goals in the morning and before reflecting on them in the evening.\n\n* /report - Your feedback is valuable to me! If you would like to tell me about something that frustrated you, something that didn't work, or what I could have done better, please send this command and follow the instructions. You can do this any time! The more detailed your feedback is, the better!"
