    "Typically, you talk to me only when I ask you a question, though it may be possible to initiate a conversation with me on your own (see the special commands below). The answers that I request from you can be of various types, including typing out messages, inputting numbers, and selecting from given choices, among others. To help you understand how to answer, <b>I will send you a message after each question telling you how to respond</b> - look out for these! :eyes:\n\nI will ask you questions either at different points during the day, or right after you have answered another question. So, please bear with me to answer all the questions until I tell you that we are finished!\n\nIf you don't answer certain questions, I will also send you periodic reminders for you to answer them, so that you can move on with the next steps.",
    "<b>Special Commands:</b>\n\n* /help - If you need me to remind you of these instructions at any time, just send this command! \n\n* /repeat - If you need me to repeat a question before you have had the chance to submit a complete answer, send this command, and I will ask the question again! Keep in mind that you will <b>have to enter your full answer from the beginning after I repeat the question.</b> If there are no outstanding questions, then you will just have to wait for the next time that I ask you one!\n\n* /talk - If you want to initiate a conversation with me about a particular topic, you can send this command. However, you can do this only to update your goals, after you have set your goals in the morning and before you reflect on them in the evening.\n\n* /report - Your feedback is valuable to me! If you would like to tell me about something that frustrated you, something that didn't work, or what I could have done better, please send this command and follow the instructions. You can do this any time! The more detailed your feedback is, the better!"
